# Pig-game
## Concept: 
Pig Game is a turn-based dice-rolling game for two players. Players take turns rolling a single die and accumulating points until one reaches a target score (usually 100) or rolls a double (causing them to lose all their accumulated points for that turn).
## Gameplay:
- Turns: Players take turns rolling the die.
- Rolling: Each player can roll the die as many times as they want during their turn.
- Scoring: Each roll adds the rolled number to the player's current score.
- Holding: During their turn, a player can choose to "hold" and pass the turn, keeping their accumulated points for that turn.
- Double Penalty: Rolling a double (same number on both dice) loses all accumulated points for that turn.
- Winning: The first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100) wins the game.
